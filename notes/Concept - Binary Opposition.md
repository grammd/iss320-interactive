# Concept - Binary Opposition

A pair of contrasting concepts used in analysis (e.g. [[Concept - Gemeinschaft]] vs. [[Concept - Gesellschaft]]). See [[Author - Ferdinand Tönnies]]. In structuralism, binary opposition is a fundamental organizer of language and thought: each term gains meaning in reciprocal determination with its opposite (e.g. "hot" in relation to "cold").
