# Concept - Periphery

Marginal or dependent region in world-systems. See [[Concept - Core]], [[Concept - Semi Periphery]]. The periphery has low-skill, labour-intensive industries and extraction of raw materials, which reinforces the dominance of the core; "development of underdevelopment" describes how poorer regions are impoverished as core countries get richer.
