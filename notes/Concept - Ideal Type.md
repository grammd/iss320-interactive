# Concept - Ideal Type

Weberian analytical construct (e.g. [[Concept - Gemeinschaft]]/[[Concept - Gesellschaft]]). [[Author - Ferdinand Tönnies]]. For Weber, the conduct of social science depends on constructing abstract, hypothetical concepts; the ideal type is a subjective element that helps distinguish sociology from natural science.
