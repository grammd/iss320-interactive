# Concept - Human Nature

Assumptions about fixed human traits. Debated in [[Concept - State of Nature]] and [[Concept - Utopia]] discussions. Human nature is often taken to mean the fundamental dispositions and characteristics humans are said to have naturally; arguments about it have been central to philosophy for centuries, including debates over nature versus nurture and whether a fixed essence exists.
