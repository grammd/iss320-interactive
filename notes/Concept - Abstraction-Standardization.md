# Concept - Abstraction-Standardization

Standardization and abstraction in modern design and planning. Related to [[Concept - Modernization Theory]] and [[Author - Le Corbusier]]. Modernist architecture and planning often sought to replace local variation with universal standards and abstract forms, prioritising efficiency and repeatability across different contexts.
