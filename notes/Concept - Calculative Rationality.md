# Concept - Calculative Rationality

Rational calculation as a mode of thought in modern society. [[Author - Georg Simmel]]. See [[Concept - Money Economy]], [[Concept - The Enlightenment]]. Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason; in practical rationality, a decision is rational when the chosen option best serves one's goals, which Simmel linked to the calculative logic of the money economy.
