# Author - Ferdinand Tönnies

## Bio
Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936) was a German sociologist known for the distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. He used these categories to classify social relationships into two types: Gesellschaft is associated with modern society and rational self-interest, which weakens the traditional bonds of family and local community that typify Gemeinschaft. Max Weber wrote extensively about the relationship between the two in direct response to Tönnies.
