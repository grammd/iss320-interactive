# Concept - Division of Labor

Specialization of tasks in society. Central to [[Concept - Gesellschaft]] and modern urban life. See [[Author - Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Author - Georg Simmel]]. The separation of tasks allows specialisation; increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and greater complexity of industrialised processes.
