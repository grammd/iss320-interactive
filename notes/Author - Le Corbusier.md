## Bio
Le Corbusier (1887–1965) was a Swiss-French architect and urban planner known for modernist designs. Influenced by [[Concept - The Enlightenment]] and rational planning.

## Key Ideas
- Advocates for "Man's Way": Straight-line, goal-oriented urban planning vs. organic, meandering growth ([[Concept - Pack-Donkey's Way]]).
- Cities should be rectilinear, efficient, and based on reason, as seen in Roman plans.
- Critiques organic city growth (e.g., Pack-Donkey's Way leading to capillary-like streets in cities like Paris).
