# Concept - Haussmannization

Large-scale rational reordering of Paris under Haussmann. Related to [[Concept - Social Engineering]], [[Author - Le Corbusier]]-style planning. Haussmann's renovation (1853–1870) included demolition of medieval neighbourhoods, wide avenues, new parks and sewers, and annexation of suburbs; the street plan of central Paris today is largely his legacy.
