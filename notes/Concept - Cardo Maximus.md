# Concept - Cardo Maximus

Main north–south axis in Roman city planning. Related to [[Concept - Decumanus]], rational planning, [[Author - Le Corbusier]]. In ancient Roman cities and camps the cardo was the main north–south street; the cardo maximus crossed the decumanus maximus at the centre (groma), with the forum normally near this intersection.
