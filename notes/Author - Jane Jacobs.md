# Author - Jane Jacobs

## Bio
Jane Jacobs (1916–2006) was an American-Canadian journalist and urbanist who advocated for dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and bottom-up planning. Her book *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961) argued that urban renewal and slum clearance often disregarded the needs of city-dwellers. She organized grassroots efforts against projects such as the Lower Manhattan Expressway and, after moving to Toronto, opposed the Spadina Expressway; her ideas eventually gained wide acknowledgment in urban planning.
