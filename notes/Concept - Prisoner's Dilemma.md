# Concept - Prisoner's Dilemma

Game-theoretic scenario about cooperation vs. defection. Used in discussions of collective action and trust (e.g. [[Concept - Gemeinschaft]]). In the thought experiment, two rational agents can either cooperate for mutual benefit or defect for individual gain; defecting is rational for each yet cooperation yields a higher payoff for both, and in repeated play cooperation can emerge.
