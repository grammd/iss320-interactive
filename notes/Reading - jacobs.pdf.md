Excerpts from Jane Jacobs on [[Concept - Eyes on the Street]], [[Concept - Street Ballet]], and neighborhood vitality. Her book *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961) argued that urban renewal and slum clearance did not respect the needs of city-dwellers; she organised grassroots efforts against projects such as the Lower Manhattan Expressway and later the Spadina Expressway in Toronto.
